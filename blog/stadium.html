  <h1>Running the Harvard stadium</h1>
<p>May 23, 2024</p>
<p>My friends and I took the habit to run the stairs at the Harvard stadium.
The principle is simple: walk (or run!) up the big steps and down the small ones  every row (37 times).
I record my time every week to keep track of my progress:</p>

<p>We can observe a few trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>the time improves when I went consistently (high density of points along the time axis)  </li>
<li>not going for a few weeks resulted in higher times  </li>
<li>there is some plateau time that I probably won't cross if I keep doing it this way  </li>
<li>temperature seems to be a factor of performance.</li>
</ul>
