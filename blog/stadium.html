  <h1>Running the Harvard stadium</h1>
<p>May 23, 2024</p>
<p>My friends introduced me a while ago to something I initially found a bit stupid and very painful: running the stairs at the Harvard stadium.
Victim of the group effect, I started to run with them regularly and I now try to join every week.
The principle is simple: walk (or run!) up the big steps and down the small ones every row, for a total of 37 rows.
I have recorded my time every week to keep track of my progress:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/blog/stadium/raw_times.svg" /></p>
<p>The dashed line shows the window average over 6 consecutive times (red markers).
We can observe a few trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>the time improves when I went consistently (high density of points along the time axis)  </li>
<li>not going for a few weeks resulted in higher times  </li>
<li>there is some plateau time that I will never reach, at least not with my current technique  </li>
</ul>
