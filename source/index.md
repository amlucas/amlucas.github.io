Welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University in the [computational science and engineering laboratory](https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/).  
My research interests include microfluidics, red blood cell modeling, blood flow simulations, artificial microswimmers, reinforcement learning, high performance computing and Bayesian inference.  
The most fun part for me is to combine multiple aspects of the above!
