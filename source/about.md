# About

Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Lucas Amoudruz, I'm currently a research associate at Harvard University in the [computational science and engineering laboratory](https://cse-lab.seas.harvard.edu/).  
My research interests include numerical simulations of microfluidics, red blood cells modeling, blood flow simulations, artificial microswimmers, reinforcement learning, high performance computing, cloud computing and Bayesian inference.  
The most fun part for me is to combine multiple aspects of the above!
