# Running the Harvard stadium

May 23, 2024

My friends introduced me a while ago to something I initially found a bit stupid and very painful: running the stairs at the Harvard stadium.
Victim of the group effect, I started to run with them regularly and I now try to join every week.
The principle is simple: walk (or run!) up the big steps and down the small ones every row, for a total of 37 rows.
I have recorded my time every week to keep track of my progress:

It looks like I have reached some kind of a plateau, but the initial learning curve was steep!
I believe that it was about learning how to pace myself. 
Probably a bit of improved fitness helped too.
